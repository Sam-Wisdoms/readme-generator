# Title: README Generator

## A README Generator 
This project is a README Generator that is created using Node.js and Command Line Interface.

## Tools Used
The tools that were used in creating this project are;
1. JavaScript
2. Node.js
3. NPM library
4. Command Line Interface

## Challenges
The challenge I have had creating this application is that, was some characters displaying in the README file that I have generated.
Also, I have had some difficulties with how Node.js works in the terminal but I got a better understanding in the end.
